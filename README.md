# lib-web-wglr-sb.dev
.. this is targeted only for one application; compiles existing modules. Plus a small class as a prototype for application to use.

1) this code is only targeted to one application.
2) the nightly build compiles the deps + sec updates and combines with our small class to store data for gpu-lines. This is the only custom part. 

### temporary

1) pretty sure I am gonna get a bit dispondent about cjs and esm.. since i like esm. and i think all the code is likely cjs ...


#### status

1) check out the deps, I havent looked at this stuff for quite some time, no idea what is cjs or esm... doing this somewhere else....
2) kinda avoid getting sentimental about what i did before which is rewriting parts of regl.. and really silly .. this time we just use their stuff fully
