# lib-web-wglr-sb.dev
.. this is targeted only for one application; compiles existing modules. Plus a small class as a prototype for application to use.

1) this code is only targeted to one application. application is GPL the code is prob MIT and bsd hmmm, I guess that is all fine. I could rewrite it all if I need to ... 
2) the nightly build compiles the deps + sec updates and combines with our small class to store data for gpu-lines. This is the only custom part. 

### temporary

1) pretty sure I am gonna get a bit dispondent about cjs and esm.. since i like esm. and i think all the code is likely cjs ...


#### status

1) ~~check out the deps, I havent looked at this stuff for quite some time, no idea what is cjs or esm... doing this somewhere else....~~ tis cjs we can use it esm though
2) ~~kinda avoid getting sentimental about what i did before which is rewriting parts of regl.. and really silly .. this time we just use their stuff fully~~
3) ~~sorry I gotta fork all your projects since people go mad and delete their stuff...  and i need to rely on this code so i dont need to do it until i can finish my own tiny engine thing~~
4) lets choose a build system .... hmmm , rolllup will do ..
5) hmmm I might need to eat.. probably all your getting for now.. since i need to look at those forks first..
