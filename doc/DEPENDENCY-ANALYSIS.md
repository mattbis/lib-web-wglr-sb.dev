Its come to my attention; despite wanting to brutally rewrite parts of regl myself. That I am mad to do so. So we are using regl, and choosing a combination of modules that satisfy our projects criterion.

Hokay we have:-

https://rreusser.github.io/regl-gpu-lines/ --> https://github.com/rreusser/regl-gpu-lines

-->

regl...  and ... cjs

https://github.com/rreusser/regl-gpu-lines


https://github.com/gl-vis/regl-line2d


https://github.com/flekschas/regl-line

github.com/deluksic/regl-insta-lines

yep its all a bit old, but fine No way I am writing that all myself

last time I wrote a brutally optmised rewrite into 7 classes of regl using default params,.. it was pretty impressive looking back but i didn't finish it.. we gotta just use what they did before we did that.. we could convert some of vec2 etc and vec3 but lets just get an edge working...I will post some code that i did before see the graveyard..
